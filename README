Installation

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d.

    git clone https://gitlab.com/mark.feller/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, packages will be downloaded
and installed via the public repos. If you encounter any errors at that
stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly running 'M-x
package-refresh-contents' before doing so. After successfully installing
packages future startups will be much faster.

There are several subdirectories:

'core'        holds primary configuration that I feel lost without.
'lisp'        holds custom user lisp code. Useful for site packages,
              personal information, etc.
'modules'     holds package/language specific configuration that is
              useful when working with specific tasks or within specific
              languages, but are not needed generally.
'src'         holds the Emacs source directory for jumping to definition
              and viewing docs within the C code.
'snippets'    holds Yasnippet snippets.
'theme'       holds theme packages. Poet is my current goto.

Disclaimer

This is an everchanging and evolving Emacs configuration for my personal
use. I see this repo more as a collection of ideas to be incorporated
into your own configurations.
